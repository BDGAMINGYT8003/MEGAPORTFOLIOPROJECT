                We are The Ectoplasmic Investigators, a team of four cousin brothers driven by a shared fascination with the paranormal that plagues rural Bangladesh. What began as a youthful curiosity and hobby has evolved into a dedicated pursuit of understanding and confronting the unseen forces that disrupt our world. We operate with a profound belief in the paranormal, recognizing it not as folklore, but as a tangible reality orchestrated by entities beyond our ordinary perception. Our investigations are rooted in the conviction that these disturbances are not random, but are deliberate actions from the realm of jinn, masterminds behind the enigmatic events we unravel.
